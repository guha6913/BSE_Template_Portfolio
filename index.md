# Phone Controlled Robot Arm 
This project is basically the best combination of Software Engineering and Robotics. You get build, code, and control a robot arm and learn throughout the process. 
# About the Creator 
Hi my name is Anusha, i go to Saratoga High School and i am a incoming sophomore. I have always been interested in coding and robotics, which is why i chose this project. This project is perfect combination of both of my interests, it helps me learn new things as well as use my prior expieeriance. When i say prior expieriance i mean being a part of robotics teams since i was in 4th Grade. I also have taken several coding class in Python and Java. So that is a little about me and now i will show you my project and the process i went through to make it.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is all about building and coding the actual robot arm. This requires both mechanical and softeare engineering. To begin with i started assembling the base and added two types of arduino's onto the base. Then i attached a servo onto the bottom of a square plate that is held up by standoffs. Then i attached another square plate to the top of the servo which made the plate rotate. After that i worked on the actual arm. I took another servo and attached it to another plate and attached that to the square plate that was the rotating plate. From there i continued to make the arm with many pieces like the ladder like piece and the thing long connecting pieces. After the arm was built i started making the claw. Here i took a small rectangular plate with a rectangle and two flaps shape cut out. In this hole i put a servo and two other pieces that would help attach the claw to the arm. Then i put another of the same plate two sandwhich a part of the servo so it would stay in place. After this i attached the two claw arms and then attached the completed claw onto the arm. Now that the actual arm is built i then made the circit. Originally it was supposed to use the arduinos that i had added but since that wasn't functioning properly i used a breadboard and a different arduino. First i attached two small yellow wires to each servos red and brown wires. I took the other end of these yellow wires and attached it to the positive and negative parts of the breadboard. Then i attached mate to male jumper wires to the orange wire of each of the servos. These jumper wires then attached to the arduino. After this i put the HC-05 Bluetook module to the bread board and used wires to connect it to the arduino. This concludes the summary of Milestone 2.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to learn how to opperate a servo motor using a app. To do this i had to use a arduino, bluetooth module, and jumper wires to assemble the circut needed for the servo motor to spin. I also had to create a blutooth connection code and upload it to the arduino in order for the app to connect to the servo. Once all this was done i was finally able to make the servo spin. This summerizes what i did for the First Milestone.
