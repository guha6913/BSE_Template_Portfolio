# Phone Controlled Robot Arm 
This project is basically the best combination of Software Engineering and Robotics. You get build, code, and control a robot arm and learn throughout the process. 
# About the Creator 
Hi my name is Anusha, i go to Saratoga High School and i am a incoming sophomore. I have always been interested in coding and robotics, which is why i chose this project. This project is perfect combination of both of my interests, it helps me learn new things as well as use my prior expieeriance. When i say prior expieriance i mean being a part of robotics teams since i was in 4th Grade. I also have taken several coding class in Python and Java. So that is a little about me and now i will show you my project and the process i went through to make it.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is all about building and coding the actual robot arm. This requires both mechanical and softeare engineering. To begin with i started assembling the base and added two types of arduino's onto the base. Then i attached a servo onto the base aswell.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to learn how to opperate a servo motor using a app. To do this i had to use a arduino, bluetooth module, and jumper wires to assemble the circut needed for the servo motor to spin. I also had to create a blutooth connection code and upload it to the arduino in order for the app to connect to the servo. Once all this was done i was finally able to make the servo spin. This summerizes what i did for the First Milestone.
